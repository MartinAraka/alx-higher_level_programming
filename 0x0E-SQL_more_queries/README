SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a powerful tool for managing and manipulating data in relational databases. It allows users to perform a variety of tasks, including querying data, inserting new records, updating existing records, and deleting data. SQL operates through simple, yet powerful commands that enable users to interact with databases efficiently. With its standardized syntax and broad support across database management systems, SQL is an essential skill for anyone working with data-driven applications and systems.
