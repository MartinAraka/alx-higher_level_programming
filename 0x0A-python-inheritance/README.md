Inheritance in Python is a powerful feature of object-oriented programming that allows classes to inherit attributes and methods from other classes. With inheritance, a new class, known as a subclass, can be created based on an existing class, known as a superclass. This enables code reuse, as the subclass inherits the behavior of the superclass and can also add new functionality or override existing methods as needed. Inheritance promotes code organization, modularity, and extensibility, allowing for the creation of hierarchical class structures and facilitating the development of scalable and maintainable software solutions. In Python, classes can inherit from one or multiple superclasses, enabling flexible and dynamic object-oriented designs.
