In Python, "Everything is an object" means that every entity in Python, whether it's a number, string, function, or even a module, is represented as an object. Objects in Python have attributes (data) and methods (functions) associated with them, and they can be passed around, assigned to variables, and manipulated dynamically. This object-oriented nature of Python allows for powerful abstraction, encapsulation, and polymorphism, enabling developers to write clean, modular, and reusable code. Understanding that everything in Python is an object is fundamental to grasping the language's design philosophy and its expressive power in handling diverse programming tasks.
