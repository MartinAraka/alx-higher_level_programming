"Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) in Python is a programming technique that facilitates the conversion of data between object-oriented programming languages, like Python, and relational databases, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL. It simplifies database interactions by representing database entities as objects in code, allowing developers to work with familiar object-oriented concepts rather than directly dealing with SQL queries. ORM frameworks, like SQLAlchemy or Django's ORM, automate the mapping between database tables and Python classes, enabling seamless integration between application code and database operations. ORM enhances code readability, maintainability, and portability, making it a powerful tool for developers building database-driven applications in Python."
