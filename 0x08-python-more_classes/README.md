In Python, classes serve as blueprints for creating objects, which are instances of those classes. Objects encapsulate both data (attributes) and behavior (methods), allowing for a structured and organized way to model real-world entities. Attributes represent the state or characteristics of an object, while methods define the actions or behaviors it can perform. Through instantiation, objects are created from classes, enabling the reuse of code and promoting modularity in programming. Concepts like inheritance enable the creation of specialized classes that inherit attributes and methods from parent classes, while polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated interchangeably. Understanding classes and objects is fundamental to object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python, providing a powerful tool for building complex and modular software systems.
