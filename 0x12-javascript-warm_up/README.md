JavaScript is a versatile scripting language primarily used for web development. Its key concepts include variables, data types, functions, and control flow statements. Understanding how to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) is crucial for dynamic web page interaction. Additionally, asynchronous programming with callbacks, promises, and async/await is fundamental for handling events and managing non-blocking operations effectively. Familiarity with JavaScript frameworks/libraries like React, Angular, or Vue can greatly enhance your development capabilities.
