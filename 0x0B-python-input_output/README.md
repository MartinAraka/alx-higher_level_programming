"Input/Output in Python refers to the mechanisms for reading data into a program (input) and writing data from a program (output). Python provides versatile ways to handle input/output operations, allowing developers to interact with files, standard input/output streams, and external resources such as databases and network sockets. Through built-in functions and modules like open() for file operations, input() for user input, and print() for displaying output, Python offers a flexible and intuitive approach to manage data flow, enabling developers to create robust applications for various purposes efficiently.
